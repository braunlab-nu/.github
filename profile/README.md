# Welcome to the Braun Lab!

[We are a research group at Northwestern University.](https://sites.northwestern.edu/braunlab/) Working at the interface between mathematics, statistics, physics, and biology, we develop and apply powerful computational methods to investigate living systems at multiple scales â€” from the atomic level, to the gene level, to the systems level, to the tissue/organismal level, and finally to the population level.  We apply these methods in close collaboration with experimentalists to investigate circadian regulation, cancer, and development.
